# Generative-AI-pipeline-for-DevOps-Automation

This AI pipeline **automates the task of testing a DevOps python script operating on a single folder**. It currently tests one-folder operations (such as removing duplicates, cleanup, archiving old files, and so on).

**Key Features**
- Modular design: it allows future integration of multi-folder comparisons;
- Designed to save time by reducing the need for manual folder inspections;
- It accepts a description of a python script (that will operate on the folder) and the folder path;
- Uses generative AI to analyze whether the script worked as intended.
